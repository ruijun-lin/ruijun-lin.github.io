My interests are operator algebra, harmonic analysis and related topics. My graduate thesis supervisor as well as academic advisor is Søren Eilers , whose research interest lies mainly in operator algebra and functional analysis, especially graph C*-algebras, classification of C*-algebras, and K-theory for operator algebras related with them. My bachelor’s degree was awarded at Southern University of Science and Technology , Shenzhen China. My undergraduate academic advisor was Yifei Zhu , whose research interests are algebraic topology and related fields, particularly in its connections to algebraic geometry and number theory via objects such as formal groups, elliptic curves, and modular forms. Currently he is also discussing topics in computational topology and topological data analysis. My undergraduate thesis supervisor was Bochen Liu , whose research interests are harmonic analysis, geometric measure theory and combinatorics. I will pursue my PhD degree supervised by Distinguished Professor Aidan Sims focusing on operator algebras related to graphs and groupoids at the University of Wollongong , Australia (expected) in August 2025.

Definition. (filter) A filter on a set $X$ is a collection $\\mathcal{F}$ that is (i) downward directed: $A,B\\in \\mathcal{F}$ implies there exists $C\\in \\mathcal{F}$ such that $C\\subseteq A\\cap B$, (ii) nonempty: $\\mathcal{F} \\neq \\varnothing$, (iii) upward closed: $A\\in \\mathcal{F}$ and $A\\subseteq B$ implies $B\\in \\mathcal{F}$. An additional property is often useful: (iv) proper: there exists $A\\subseteq X$ such that $A\\notin \\mathcal{F}$. Remarks: Being downward directed and upward closed implies that filters are closed under finite intersections, and being proper is equivalent to the requirement that $\\varnothing \\notin \\mathcal{F}$. $2^{X}$ is itself a filter but not proper. A set that is only downward directed and nonempty is called a filterbase. Any filterbase generates a filter simply by taking the upward closure of the base. Examples. (trivial filter) For any set $X$ there is the smallest filter ${X}$ called the trivial filter. (eventuality filter) Given a sequence ${x_{n}}$ in a space $X$, the set $\\mathcal{E}_ {x_n} = \\lbrace A \\subseteq X \\mid \\text{ there exists an } N \\text{ so that } x_n \\in A \\text{ for all } n \\geq N \\rbrace$ is a proper filter. (non-example, open neighborhoods of a point $x$) Given a topological space $X$ and a point $x\\in X$ , the collection of open neighborhoods of $x$ denoted by $\\mathcal{T}_{x}$, is generally not a filter, but a filterbase. Definition. (convergence) A filter $\\mathcal{F}$ on a topological space $(X,\\mathcal{T})$ converges to $x$ if and only if $\\mathcal{F}$ refines $\\mathcal{T}_x$, that is, if $\\mathcal{T}_x \\subseteq \\mathcal{F}$. When $\\mathcal{F}$ converges to $x$ we will write $\\mathcal{F} \\rightarrow x$. As an easy observation, a sequence ${x_{n}}$ converges to a point $x$ if and only if $\\mathcal{E}_{x_n}$. With the concept of filters, we now give an equivalence statement between the categorical limit and the topological limit. Let $X$ be a topological space and $\\mathcal{F}_X$ be the collenction of all filters on $X$. Given $x \\in X$ and $F \\in \\mathcal{F}_{X}$, let $\\mathcal{U}_X(x)$ be the neighborhood filter of $x$, which is the filter generated by $\\mathcal{T}_x$ and let $$ \\mathcal{F}_{x,F} = \\lbrace G \\in \\mathcal{F}_X \\mid \\mathcal{F} \\cup \\mathcal{U}_X(x) \\subseteq G \\rbrace $$ be the collection of all the filters containing both $F$ and the neighborhood filter of $x$. We observed that $F \\subseteq F \\cup \\mathcal{U}_ X(x) \\subseteq \\bigcap_{G\\in \\mathcal{F}_ {x,F}}G,$ and the latter two sets are filters. Also since $\\bigcap_ {G\\in \\mathcal{F}_ {x,F}}G$ is the smallest filter containing $F \\cup \\mathcal{U}_ X(x)$ and $F \\cup \\mathcal{U}_ X(x)$ is itself a filter, we have that $\\bigcap_{G\\in \\mathcal{F}_ {x,F}}G \\subseteq F \\cup \\mathcal{U}_ X(x)$ so that $\\bigcap_ {G\\in \\mathcal{F}_ {x,F}}G = F \\cup \\mathcal{U}_ X(x)$. View the inclusion of sets “$\\subseteq$” as a partial order on $\\mathcal{F}_ X$ and $\\mathcal{F}_ {X,F}$. Then $\\mathcal{F}_ X$ becomes a small category and $\\mathcal{F}_ {X,F}$ is its subcategory. Let $E : \\mathcal{F}_ {X,F} \\to \\mathcal{F}_X$ be the embedding functor. Now we have a theorem indicating the connection between the categorical limit and the topological limit. Theorem. $x$ is a topological limit of the filter $F$ if and only if $F$ is a categorical limit of the functor $E$. Proof. $x$ is a topological limit of the filter $F$, i.e., $F \\to x$ $\\Leftrightarrow (\\mathcal{T}_x \\subseteq \\mathcal{U}(x)) \\subseteq F \\ \\text{and} \\ F \\cup \\mathcal{U}(x) \\subseteq F$ $F = \\bigcap_{G \\in \\mathcal{F}_{X,F}} g$ (the universal object) $\\Leftrightarrow (F \\xrightarrow{p_{G}}E(G))_ {G \\in \\mathcal{F}_ {x,F}}$ is a limit cone of $E$ (i.e., $F$ is a categorical limit of $E$) References Bradley, T.-D., Terilla, J. and Bryson, T.
