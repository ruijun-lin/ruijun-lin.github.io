## Music
Music is a part of my life. I learned erhu (a kind of Chinese traditional instrument) in my childhood and began to learn to play the piano after graduating from the senior high school. I love both of them, and my favorite types of music are classical music, new age and Chinese traditional music.

The following is my latest piano cover *Sun and Dew* composed by my piano teacher Jianyang Wu, who is also a composer. I record this video in honor of him.

The following is another of my piano covers *In the Morning Light* composed by Yanni. It is the first piece of music totally practiced by myself.

## Railway infrastructures
To help myself and others understand the meanings of names of metro stations and railway stations in Copenhagen, Denmark, I built a Notion document with a list to collect them.
You can find it here: [Meanings of Copenhagen Metro, S-train and Regional train station names](https://www.notion.so/Meanings-of-Copenhagen-Metro-S-train-Regional-train-Inter-city-train-and-Local-train-station-nam-e2a154e226c54a1f9851e359c6d76eb8?pvs=4).
