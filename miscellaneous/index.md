## Music
Music is a part of my life. I learned erhu (a kind of Chinese traditional instrument) in my childhood and began to learn to play the piano after graduating from the senior high school. I love both of them, and my favorite types of music are classical music, new age and Chinese traditional music.

The following is my latest piano cover *Sun and Dew* composed by my piano teacher Jianyang Wu, who is also a composer. I record this video in honor of him.

The following is another of my piano covers *In the Morning Light* composed by Yanni. It is the first piece of music totally practiced by myself.

## Railway infrastructures
I am interested in the railway transportation stuff in China and the world, especially the high-speed rail and metro lines that have been built, under construction and under planning in China.

To help myself and others understand the meanings of names of metro stations and railway stations in Copenhagen, Denmark, I built a Notion document with a list to collect them.
You can find it here: [Meanings of Copenhagen Metro, S-train and Regional train station names](https://www.notion.so/Meanings-of-Copenhagen-Metro-S-train-Regional-train-Inter-city-train-and-Local-train-station-nam-e2a154e226c54a1f9851e359c6d76eb8?pvs=4).
